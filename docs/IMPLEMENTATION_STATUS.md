# Implementation status

Last updated: 2026-10-04 · Version 0.1.0 (pre-release) · Branch `claude/wizardly-einstein-7gjfr0`

## Summary

Every internal build stage (1–8) is implemented: data model, settings registry, setup, accounts, permissions, delegation, authentication (password, TOTP, Google linking, console recovery), storage, versions, renewals, archive, imports, OCR/previews/extraction, search, UI/PWA/themes, offline/export, reminders over three channels, sharing, IMAP import, audit, backup/restore/integrity, native operations tooling, CI and documentation.

**Release readiness: not yet approved for family production use.** The code and its automated tests are complete for the initial scope. The remaining release gates need environments that were not available in the build container (see Blockers). Per the release rules, the first family release should wait until AT-26 (Debian 13 install/upgrade) and AT-24 (restore on a clean LXC) have been validated on the real Proxmox host.

## Completed (with evidence)

- Backend: 119 automated tests passing (`docs/TEST_REPORT.md`).
- Frontend: type-checked production build; 13-step browser end-to-end flow passing on desktop and mobile viewports; screenshots in `docs/screenshots/`.
- Tooling: guided installers `scripts/proxmox-create-lxc.sh` (Proxmox host: creates the container) and `scripts/easy-install.sh` (inside the LXC: asks all parameters and installs, configures, connects the NAS, backs up and checks); `scripts/personaldocs` (install, upgrade, rollback, repair, status, doctor, backup, restore, integrity, recover-admin, setup-token, logs, manage, nas-apply), systemd units, `scripts/verify.sh`, GitHub Actions CI with prebuilt frontend release asset.
- Documentation: 27 bundled guides (`docs/guides/`), requirements, traceability, architecture and 6 ADRs, generated settings reference, test report, release checklist, changelog.

## Blockers (external validation)

| Gate | Needed |
|---|---|
| AT-26 native install, interrupted rerun, upgrade, rollback, repair | A fresh Debian 13 LXC on the Proxmox host, plus the real private repository URL and a read-only token |
| AT-24 restore on a clean LXC | Second LXC (or reinstall) and a mounted NAS share |
| Guided installers and NAS mounting on real hosts | A Proxmox host, a privileged LXC with `mount=nfs;cifs`, and a real NFS/SMB share (only dry runs and a simulated `systemctl` were possible here) |
| AT-17 live SMTP/Telegram | SMTP relay credentials; a Telegram bot token |
| AT-19 live IMAP | A test mailbox |
| AT-21 live Google | A Google Cloud OAuth client and the public HTTPS origin |
| AT-14 real devices | An Android phone and an iPhone |
| AT-27 resource-constrained load | Benchmark on the 2 vCPU / 4 GB LXC with realistic multi-page scans |

None of these are being reported as passed. Exact steps are in `docs/TEST_REPORT.md`.

## Known limitations and simplifications

- Browser offline storage behaviour (quota, account switching) is implemented but covered by manual steps, not automated tests.
- The audit log records document views on the detail endpoint. File and preview fetches are not individually audited, except downloads.
- The accessibility audit is automated (axe-core, WCAG 2.1 A/AA) and clean; a manual screen-reader review has not been done.

## Next executable steps

1. Push the repository to the private GitHub remote. Create a fine-grained read-only token.
2. On the Proxmox host run `scripts/proxmox-create-lxc.sh` (or create a Debian 13 LXC and run `scripts/easy-install.sh` inside it), following `docs/guides/installation.md#guided`. Record results in `TEST_REPORT.md`.
3. Configure NPM or Pangolin, then check the NAS connection in Settings → Storage & backup. Run *Back up now*, then a restore drill on a second LXC.
4. Configure SMTP, Telegram and, optionally, Google. Run the live checks listed in the test report.
5. Run `scripts/bench_processing.py` on the LXC with realistic scans. Tune `processing.heavy_concurrency` and `PD_PROCESS_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB`.
6. Tag `v0.1.0` once the gates pass (`docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`).

## Session log

- 2026-10-04: closed the previous limitations — resizable panels (mouse and keyboard, remembered per account), per-device session list with individual sign-out, optional folder templates for new members, event notifications (access granted, import finished, processing failed, backup failed, integrity problems), PDF/A-2b validation (veraPDF when installed, structural check otherwise), automated accessibility audit with a CI end-to-end job. Fixed during verification: an outbox duplicate-key insert could break an enclosing transaction (now a savepoint); changing your own password signed out the current device (now only other devices).

- 2026-10-03: initial implementation of the whole scope. Commands run are summarised in `TEST_REPORT.md`. Fixed during verification: a row lock on an outer join in processing; backup folder name collisions and pruning order (now sorted by manifest time); `on_commit` handling in tests; idempotent retry of completed browser import items; Chrome PDF preview blocked by CSP sandbox (sandbox now applied only to non-PDF/image responses).
- 2026-10-04: NAS connection moved into Settings → Storage & backup (NFS or SMB, validated fields, Connect/Disconnect, live status and actionable errors). The web app writes a request file; a path-activated root helper (standard library only, re-validates every field, fixed mount unit `/mnt/pdnas`, SMB credentials in a root-only file) mounts the share, creates the backup folder, checks write access and the app adopts it as the backup destination. New guided installers ask every parameter and perform the whole LXC installation; `manage.py apply_settings` applies validated settings from a file.
